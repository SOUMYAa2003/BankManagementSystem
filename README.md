The primary ATM interface, which offers all of its functions, serves as the foundation for this project.
It first displays a login screen asking for the user's card number and pin.It will provide a sign-up option if the user is new.The user will be required to provide certain information on the sign-up page, which will be stored in a database.
The user will see a list of services that the ATM can offer after logging in.
The following functionalities are available:
1. Quick Cash 3. Deposit 2. Balance Inquiry
4. Brief Proclamation
5. Switching Pins
6. Withdrawal
I've made an effort to design an interface that is simple to use and appropriately identifies the demands of any user.
I'm grateful.
